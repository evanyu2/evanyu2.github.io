	<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Walla Walla, WA</li> 
		<li> Magic City, ID</li> 
		<li> Bountiful, UT</li>
		<li> Last Chance, CO</li>
		<li> Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
		<li> Why, AZ </li>
	</ol>

	<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
  	<q>Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity.</q>  
  	I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
	
	<p>June 2, 2012</p>
	<p>My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
	I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>cellphone</li>
		<li>iPod</li>
		<li>digital camera</li>
		<li>protein bar</li>
	<p>
		Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
